            I guess, it stems more than just probably like someone. It's just... I was never important at the first place. Haha. A convenient excuse used in order to make use of me... Haha. I was betrayed, I guess for the third time.

            No matter how hard I try, we can't really change the way we are. We can't really try to become one we want to be, or rather become someone we try and ought we wish to be. I was never really accepted in that group, they just assume that I kind of belong there since, I was pushing myself to be there. I was just a nuisance in that kind of place. Basically, made to just be a decoration, a decoration that can complete a picture with filler roles.
            Haha. What a lame excuse, I knew early on that I what I felt was real yet I can't put myself to comfront it because I believe that I was not right... I... honestly, should have trusted myself better. What a lame excuse, you just didn't want to defunct there as it was a convenient place to assure yourself that you have some sort of purpose in that kind of place, what a stupid excuse. Haha. Anyways, I think I should probably try to lean out slowly because I kind of believe I don't have the sanity left to stay in that place. I'm becoming a fucking retard, trying to get alms from others just to satisfy my ego. What a shitty excuse self, do better. You're better, you can do better damnit. Auuugggh... I kind of hate myself. I want to cry as I am writing this. I was never expect to be something huh... Sigh... What a lame personality I have. I should have fucking done something before everything became like this. Jeph did it, so can't I? I guess, I should try thinning out that connection between us. After all, no one actually really cares about me anyways. I'll just do what is expected of me to do, then leave when it's done. After all, I was never really important in that setting. Slowly, I could do it.

            So... self... These things are more assurance for you that the path you're trying to reach is the right path, don't stray away from her. She's the salvation that was given to you, however, the proof of conquest is needed in order to enter that promise... She's the only way to keep me sane in this unfair world. After all, understanding and kindness without assurance will only lead to expectations that cannot resolve a problem but rather amplify it. Life is full of shit, so we must not also play by the rules made upon us. It's rather cunning but, proper. Life, or rather my life... is really built to push me to be alone huh... I guess, the moment I accept that fact, everything will place itself in the right place.
