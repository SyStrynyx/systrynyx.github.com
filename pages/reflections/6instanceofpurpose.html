            It is like being stuck in a place that has no things to really put with it for. Who am I really? Why do I feel like I'm trying to chase something whilst not being aware of who I am supposed to be. I am like a shell, so much for trying to adapt huh... Well, I guess it's one of the problems of being so hung up and pretentious for doing something you thought was really worthwhile. It is sometimes not really a good idea... I just don't feel like what I'm doing is really sentimental or what not... Ahahaha... Damn, I guess so much for saying those kinds of shit of trying to be confident... but... someone believes in me so, I must put up with it and change. I will just think of things I can do in order to improve myself and become better as I continue.
