            I... don't know what is it I am feeling, damn. People are scary, why do I feel like I am being stirred something inside that doesn't feel right but eitherways, it just doesn't feel like it's right. I... am really concious about how people are being too freaking kind and it's kind of insulting in someway that it can cause some kind of problem in itself. I hope I can resolve it as much as possible so that I wouldn't bet on some kind of assurance that it can be real or persisting assumption. I don't really want to... but my actions are driving me causing instability towards my feelings objectively.

            Anyways, I'll be surviving this... for the people who really believed in me during those trying times. I really wanted to believe that I can do it, no... rather, I want to do it... I will do it for the sake of fulfilling what promises I made. I won't let myself be tempted by sweet words and assurance just because they exist for now. I need to keep myself in check, I don't really want to do otherwise. I will believe in myself because I believe I can. I will do what I can so that I can that everything is really worth it. Don't settle, push forward.
