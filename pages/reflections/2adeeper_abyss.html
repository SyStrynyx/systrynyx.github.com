            "Ignorance is both a bliss and a curse, causing despair and anguish while keeping us both sane and insane." After reading a freaking manga panel about the story of an empty shell inside a world that expecting you to be alive, it's hard to say that I haven't really see something so clear and what I kept as a muddy water. This manga panel was never been kind to the people to decided that they will take on the challenge and it will never be. I found that this is the culmination of the despair that those people felt for the time that they we're alive in this world. A kind of despair that they shared was possible, a despair that envelops humans who were "lucky?" enough to experience it. Are we really sane enough to conquer this insane world where it cannot be satiated with enough despair?</article> <br>

The other things might be possible with the other person if he / she reciprocates that kind of kindness where it might make or break the other person. It happened to me so, I know. </article> <br> <br>
        <article><img src="/img/2boysabyss/sensei2.jfif" alt="sensei_why..." id="right"> Anyways, I just wanted to rant out this feeling that there are indeed people who wanted for someone to rely on as well as people who only need someone to rely on. ONLY a discerning eye can distinguish between the former and the later. How I wished I realized sooner, if only then, I would have done something better...</article> <br>
