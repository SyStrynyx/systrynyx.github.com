            Finally, I guess... I got her answer. Not that I didn't expect what is it but I'm still kind of disappointed that I got it right. Haha. Pretty cruel of me, huh. Well, anyways, not that it matters anyways, I have my Aisumi in mind. I will do my best to pave the path towards her forward. I honestly believe it to be that case. <hide> I won't hide what I feel anymore because I honestly believe that pretending not to be will be a bad take from me. </hide> Anyways, I feel relieved that I can't at any moment receive that kind of assurance, that will probably make myself work better towards that path rather than escaping and finding another way for me to think about other things. I will do my best in order to not cause mistakes moving forward such as expecting something in that regards. Haha. Well, too much for hoping for a path of redemption, I guess... I just don't have a good eye for women as the friendly hopes takes over these romantic feelings. <hide> It's just too much for me to think about, it's kind of sad actually. Well, I already decided to give up anyways so, I'm happy for the way it is. </hide>

             This is just a confirmation of my earlier claims, so no need to read through with it.
             I am certain now that <span><hide> I feel like I don't stand a chance if ever I decided I will stand with it. </hide></span> I am very sorry my friends for all of the bad things I have shown towards you all after all, I am just human pretending to be a sheep in clothing. I wanted to be myself too after all, and I decided that I will be doing it for real this time because I think she will be more proud of me that way. I will be happy if ever I feel like she can be happy after all. After all, she has been my side for all of these time. I know very well the feeling of alienation and the want to be connected with someone in the end, being able to hug, feel another person's warmth and the feeling that they are someone who exist in that same space but what can I do with that feeling if it isn't intentionally directed towards me but a show in order to assure the other person that they are indeed being <span> <hide>cared</hide> </span> about, after all no one wants to make the other person against them. Right? Monika once said, that people are willing to sacrifice other people's life just for their own happiness. After all people are indeed greedy enough for them to care about other people's needs right? They just feel like there's something they need to do in order to fulfill that need, in order to create a feeling of debt towards the other person. Haha. I learned that the freaking hard way, what did I almost forget that lesson and feeling. I almost also feel down deep inside. No wonder my intuition is telling me that something is indeed wrong with what I am feeling and thinking, it's like my brain is being forced to decide between logic and feeling between two entirely different things. I don't want that kind of feeling. <span> <hide>I just don't want to feel like I'm expecting something else once again.</span></hide>

        <article> I just don't want to commit the same mistake, same feelings and disappointments I made in the past. Why did I almost forget those kind of things anyways? I had almost been done. After all, I feel like she was just being nice, and as a bee in search for sweet nectar to bleed, it must be first polinated by a sharp alien pollen. A alien feeling that people are made to expecting as it is a bet. After all, everything is just a game in front of everyone, and everyone has their own dices and pegs to play. Sometimes, things probably are hidden as to hide the reason that they should not be seen. :+ </article> <br>
