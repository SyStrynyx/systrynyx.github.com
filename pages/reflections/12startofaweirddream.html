            I had a weird dream, it involves someone who was really important to me during my high school years, whom I truly felt like I loved to the moon and back. She was really someone I hoped and wished for every single day, every second has passed and she was the only one in my mind. I felt like she was the only one destined for me. It made me felt sad, knowing that in a dream, everything was kind of like different... Why do I still have hopes... why do I felt like there's something that I have left unsaid, a bunch of memories I hoped and never will ever be fulfilled... Why did I dream about it, the first dream a had for so long and she was the first one. Why?

            I didn't think that I was still up to that weird thing... All I know is that I finally have peace within my heart as I hoped I have becase I know within myself that I made the right decision. I know for sure that I did, as it was something I'm really thankful for. A dream, so weird I didn't know I really belong in that. I mean, it's A we're talking about. It takes premise in our old school where I was dating her, I was happy beyond ever my hopes, something I couldn't recognize as a dream and was not able to take full control of it. I was acting the best as I can be, being able to share her hopes, dreams, sorrows, cries, and happiness... It was everything I could have hoped for. Being able to spend time with her. Sadly, that' terms is already beyond my wildest imagination as she... already have someone else and I don't think I would try to catch up to her at any moment as I did in the dream. Being always there for her, I... didn't know why I had hopes for that but, well, I guess atleast in a dream I was able to experience what it felt like to be accepted and be with her even though it will only remain as a dream... a dream so surreal, I wouldn't have anything to put up with it. Haha. I... don't know now. I was still kind of like confused about this whole stuff... Imagine me and her, hugging in a corridor, imagine me and her holdign each other's hands... imagine me and her spending time and actually enjoying each other's company, imagine me and her... never in our wildest dreams cross path with each other.

            Imagine me and her, in a weird dream, nothing less and nothing more. I... couldn't imagine. After all, I already got someone, whom is with my life and actually have my back.
