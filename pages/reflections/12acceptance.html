            After reflecting for a few days spending time thinking about things in oblivion, I finally realized that there are indeed things that I kind of need to rethink about. I lost my vision of what truly matters to me, I lost my way and I lost my sense of direction. I was lost in the abyss of my own thoughts and I was not able to think straight. I was not able to think about the things that I should be thinking about. I was not able to think about the things that I should be doing. I was not able to think about the things that I should be feel about. I hope I can find the hope that I wish I can find within myself. I hope I can find the courage to face the things that I should be facing. I hope I can find the strength to face the things that I should be facing. I hope I can find the hope in reaching her.

            I still think about the things that are bothering me but knowing that she's always there to cheer me on assure me that she will always be there for me. I am really thankful for her. I am really thankful for her existence even if she still doesn't exist yet but I still believe that she will always be here in my heart until that time that we reach and hold each other in my arms.
