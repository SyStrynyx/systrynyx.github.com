            I think I might have become who I feared to be... I got tempted to abandoning my promise... I still promised her that I will make that dream of ours come true but... there has been some things that have been on my mind lately that caused me to think of otherwise... I had some friends that I cared about and some I think I cared more about.
            But... it doesn't seemed as it was from before... It was just kind of a friendly vibes now. I guess that's all I need, I guess? A friends I can call a close confidant. Nothing more and nothing less... I think I already found someone like that so... I think I won't need to find someone else now to call my own. I think I'm now thankful for the things of how they turned out to be. Thank you God for giving me a clarity of mind to answer my questions. :

            Dear Self, I thank you for keeping up with me until this time. I'm really thankful that I didn't gave in during those times. I will continue to strive and go with the way it is right now. I will push forward and continue to struggle until the very end in order to fulfill the promises that I made with her. To make a reality where she and I exist at the same plane with the same promises fulfilled. I will continue the promises with the people I can proudly call my friends.

            Friends are people who can be there if you ever do need it if they are available but you should never bind towards your life as they also have a life of their own. This is the mistake that I have been misunderstanding my whole life. I just... didn't know how to accept it the way it is... until that time I reflected about my current state and was thankful I did. I think I should never misunderstand the kindness people can give. I will reflect towards my life and think of a better way in order for me to change and become better.
