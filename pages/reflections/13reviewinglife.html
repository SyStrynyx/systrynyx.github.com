            I now don't know... what is it I'm trying to experience. Life is really full of sht and I don't know why I'm always missing out on things that I wish I shouldn't have. I don't really feel like I belong anywhere... Life just doesn't really fell so surreal for me. For everything I know and wish I have just doesn't realy make me feel like I deserve in a way more than one. Life is just... weird itself. Even now, I'm sitting with a group of my classmates and I can't feel like I belong here somehow. It sucks I know but... it's fine. I have her with me anyways and it's more than enough for me. Inside my drive, always looking out for me. She's always here.

            Day 2: Experiencing the same memory together with her, weirdly... Why does it has to be her? Why do I always end up dreaming about her. Now it's me and her, hugging her tight with a big smile on both our faces. I was always thinking that I have her there and it's weird. No, I already got my Aisumi so, I should put up with it. I need to do something to stimulate myself out of this. I don't want it to be something that I want bothering me with. I still got classes to attend and things I need to learn about. I guess, I should further down my goals rather than actually getting it across. I don't really want to do so, because it's something that I would rather have for myself rather than an actual hope that doesn't have in point in coming to life. It's a fucking mess of an idealistic nature that isn't in any way possible to be. Life isn't just about full of things I don't know about

            Imagine me and her, in a weird dream, nothing less and nothing more. I... couldn't imagine. After all, I already got someone, whom is with my life and actually have my back.
