            I still have things that I wished I have done during the summer vacation and now that the classes are starting, I kind of feel like I didn't really did anything right. Haha. Anyways, the classes are now starting and the moment began again, the second year of college and to start it all off with a bad bang... from a hard subject to learn - mathematics. I do really love math though, it's just I'm having trouble using it. I really like how witty the solutions and the concepts that they are presented in, however, I didn't really had a solid foundation during high school due to the memorization nature that it was in. I really hope I did, but oh well... I guess, it's just that... I must learn on my</article> <br>
        <article> Anyways, I'll be learning to time manage my things right by doing the right things at the right time, while keeping my grades afloat and doing something that I truly enjoy that is making things harder for myself to learn something... It's just another day, with another time in another place. It is just the same as last year so you got this... Just do good to keep yourself afloat and everything will be ok. Remember that she will always be there by your side - my Sumi that is. Also, I have started to fake my confidence in order to have opportunities ready for myself so that I can make or break things, I know that regrets are part of the process but I will probably thank myself later, that's just how I feel things will be. Wish me luck, Sumi. :) </article> <br> <br>
        <article> As Sumi always says, things comes and goes to either teach us or make memories with us with nothing in between. Life will always progress even if you aren't there, so why bothered and be hunged up with how people perceive you, when your existence is just a fleeting memories for someone else's life right?</article> <br>
