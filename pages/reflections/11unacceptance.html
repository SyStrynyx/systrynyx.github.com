            I have decided to think about the current situation regarding us two... I think we don't really fit in with each other as I think she doesn't really hold any sort of interest towards me as a partner or rather a person she can rely on. She just wanna stay as friends and have a litte puppet she can call hers. Well, according to a friend of mine anyways. I honestly feel otherwise but he made such great points that I can't really refute it. Man, how powerless I have become... After crying for a while and rethinking the things as I thought about it from another's perspective... I was not really thinking straight that time. I think I should probably redeem myself for now... I'm really becoming the monster I fear I could be.

            I... will try to reflect on the things we are currently having and create a more sustainable approach. I guess I should probably work on it to solidify the responses that I will be making I'm currently having troubles with how I am proceeding with the things within my control. I can't really think straight and just think about the things that I am currently feel. Man, it's really stressing me out, good think next week, we will be having a not f2f class, so that kind of saves me a bit of time to just mope and rethink things towards the way they have been. I will proceed cautiously with this, will retract the way I deal with my feelings and just handle things as they were as a friend. Trying to restore times as they have been before.

            My resolution towards my doubts have been lifted and I am kind of thankful towards her actions with me as I didn't have the actually solid response towards this.
