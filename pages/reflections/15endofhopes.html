            I... finally took matters into my own hands and confronted the fear head on, I got my answer and settled everything once and for all. I realized that there were things that I need to reflect upon myself and check if I truly thought I was and will be worthy of having. It was a time of great distress and I was never been a fan of it. I was really lucky that I have my family that constantly asks me about my constant feeling and the things that I should probably reflect upon - that is having my hopes and dreams to fulfill. Maybe some things are just not really meant for me to experience as honestly, I am too hung up with just dreaming and dreaming is the only thing that makes it happy, so experiencing it itself is a different things. It is an alien feeling for me but I still need to work on it to accept my feelings. It was a great deal for me to talk and think about. There's just a lot of things that I am still bottling up but I am managing. Thanks to them, I am still here. I also found the answer I might as well be seeking since long. I... finally found it.
