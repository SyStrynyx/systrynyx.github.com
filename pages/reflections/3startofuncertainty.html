            Why are we so hung up on things, things already happened, nothing could be done. Why do our minds keep on telling us that we "should" did something. Sigh... I don't really understand why do I kept so hung up on things that made me realize that there could have been things that I could have done better. I just met someone who kind of reminds me of the past, I didn't get hung up onto it, but nevertheless, why do I kept being so bothered by it. It's something that already did happened, why do we need to revisit it...</article> <br>
        <article> I could have done something better in order to make the situation better for now but... I didn't. Huh, such words, such depraving words. Sometimes, it's made others think that you are taking advantage of their sympathy and that others is yourself because you are so hung up that you are scarred to take responsibility for your actions. It's kind of unfair isn't it? Anyways, it's not just one right, it's 2 encounters in a single day, most of all, it didn't bothered me at all, I guess I really did grew up? Haha. That sense of depravation, it's something that can outright cause a malice towards a person especially yourself so, please... make up with yourself and forgive because as humans are concious of their surroundings, they also need to forget a lot of things to make up for new things that they observe, what you thought bothered them for so long, can't be for long as long as it doesn't really concern them. That's just how humans are...</article> <br> <br>
        <article> As Sumi always says, things comes and goes to either teach us or make memories with us with nothing in between. Life will always progress even if you aren't there, so why bothered and be hunged up with how people perceive you, when your existence is just a fleeting memories for someone else's life right?</article> <br>
