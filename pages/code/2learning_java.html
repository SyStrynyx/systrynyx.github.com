        <h1>Learning Java...</h1>
        <h2> Is this the right decision? </h2>
        <article><i class='bx bxl-java' ></i>
            Classes are now starting, I kind of am reminded about the things that I wanted to learn yet did nothing during the summer vacation. After all, I really haven't yet found opportunities on what to make and build because I was fixated on other things to do like earning money which is kind of hard if you don't have the basics and foundation especially in the competitive space of today's generation. Sigh... I really did took my time yet haven't done something significant. But, I hope I could find the drive to do something next summer vacation with the enhanced skillsets and foundation. Yet, why am I betting everything towards "Java?"... ahahaha. Curriculum reasons but I used to love Java and even decided that it will become my first language when I was starting in 8th grade. I was really fixated on hardware during the earlier times.</article> <br>
        <article> Anyways, the reason why I am writing this blog is to keep me accountable for all the actions that I will be doing, if ever someone really ends up reading this, this might be embarassing but nevertheless, I will still do my best in order to become a programmer worthy to be able to create something that will be remembered by the world for the better. Even if I will be able to make a small dent, it will be enough for me because I do really believe that hard work with cleverness will make a person or rather a programmer in the making. That's why, I hope I could keep up the motivation to keep moving forward, all for that sake I must keep up my word. </article> <br>
