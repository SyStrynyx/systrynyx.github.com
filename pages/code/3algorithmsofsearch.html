        <h1>Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>
        <h2> How much to find a data inside? </h2>
        <article><i class='bx bxl-java' ></i>
            Starting to learn about the structure of the data and algorithm about how they are used in order to apply a search function, there comes the search algorithms. There are three main concepts involved for now, dictionaries (not generally but for our specific uses)
            queues, frontier which is the current state of the search but I would like to call it a visited queue to, or to be visited which is kind of easier to understand. The search then proceeds to load the keys in a dictionary or the word in simple terms and the definition or the content that is inside that key. Through these method we can continue to traverse the graph by locating the the next path that is inside of the key. It is really frustrating when it it coded because you can't just simply tell that it should be loaded, and most of the time, we will use for loops statements to load the next path.

            However, this is just an oversimplification of the problem, there are still a lot of things to consider like the time complexity and the space complexity. The time complexity is the time it takes for the algorithm to finish the task, while the space complexity is the amount of memory it takes to finish the task. In order to make the algorithm more efficient, we need to consider the time and space complexity. For example, if we are going to use a dictionary, we need to consider the time it takes to load the dictionary and the space it takes to load the dictionary. If we are going to use a list, we need to consider the time it takes to load the list and the space it takes to load the list. In order to make the algorithm more efficient, we need to consider the time and space complexity. For example, if we are going to use a dictionary, we need to consider the time it takes to load the dictionary and the space it takes to load the dictionary. Even though, I kind of still don't understand the implementation, that is the basics of it. Thanks for reading.
