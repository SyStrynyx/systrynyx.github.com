        <h1>Done Layouting the Initial Layout of the Blogpost</h1>
        <article><i class='bx bx-code-alt'></i>
            After a week of working on the layout, I finally found a layout that I feel contented on adopting. It was kind of a terminal like look but it serves my purpose right. I am happy with the output but it's still have some potential for it. I am also wanting to know more about my creation. Knowing him will allow me to deepen my relationship with him '*Current Self: You good bro? You'll be reading this someday. Lol'</article> <br>
        <article> Nonetheless, it was really cool, being able to make something out of my own imagination while keeping a pair of sweets and water by my side with a track of Yoasobi playing in the background. Can't say it's the best combination but it was fun doing this especially with the frustrations related to the flexes and grids. Thanks grid for not allowing me to format anchors and specifying it as another tag / entity that holds it's own property. It was frustrating but it did damage the landing page of the website. Haha. Anyways, knowing how I overcame that, I'm still proud of my no JS blog site because honestly... *Tugs down. "I still really don't know what I can do nor knowing what each syntax means. Hopefully, I will be more motivated in doing and updating this said blog post. Up until then, catch up to you to someone who reached the end of this blog. Thanks. :) "</article> <br>
