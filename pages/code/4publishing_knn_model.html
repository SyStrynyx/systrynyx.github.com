        <h1>Representing Paths to Parks using K-Nearest Neighbor</h1>
        <h2> Billena, Artacho, Constantino, Torre - CriDhomElsJeph</h2>
        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <article><i class='bx bxl-graphql bx-spin-hover' ></i>
        <bold>Have you ever wondered how your brain seems to reason out the path that you
need to take in order to reach a place?</bold>
        </article> <br> <br> <br>
        <article> Is it by using landmarks as to instruct you as to where you should meet? Is it by using
a map to know the nearest location of that landmark?
We are inclined to use the nearest neighboring places in order to reach another place
right? Since it is the most ”known” location from the place we can meet up. Which is why, I
personally give KNN another distinguishing meaning which is ”Know the Nearest Neighbor”
Classification Algorithm. I think you’re thinking that it should be KtNN right? Yes, but
hey what’s this, there’s a popping up animation of how it works.</article> <br>
    <img src="/img/code_resource/4knn_model/map_locations.png" alt=""> <br>
    <article>
        <bold>K-Nearest Neighbor</bold> is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to
solve both classification and regression tasks. <bold>Classification? Regression?</bold> An example would
you as a person, if you were to be classified, how would you be classified and related to that
group?

    <h2>Methodology / Process</h2>
    <article>
        <img src="/img/code_resource/4knn_model/rem_best_girl.png" alt=""><bold>Finding the K-Nearest Neighbors</bold> 
Thinking back about the process that landmarks are used in order to determine how close
we are to a certain place, we need to measure it to create an accurate representation of how
far each location is to each other.
    <code>

    </code><br></article>   
    <h2>Distance Measurement</h2>
    <h4>Euclidean Distance</h4>
    <article>
            Euclidean Distance is an algorithm that we can think of like a triangle ruler that we can
            use in order to measure the distance between these two points. <br>
            <math> Euclidean = sqrt((x2 − x1)^2 + (y2 − y1)^2) </math>
            <bold>Euclidean Algorithm</bold> is commonly found in finding the greatest common divisor between
            two given numbers which is enclosed by the parenthesis and squared as to why it is squared,
            well as said earlier it is a triangular ruler where the rules of the Pythagorean Equation
            matters in order to find the hypotenuse of the triangle which is the longest part of triangle
            which has the formula:
            <math>x2 + y2 = z2</math>
            In our case it is used to represent the displacement which is the Nearest Shortcut to reach
            that location. Another point to consider is why do we need to square root it, is there any
            particular reason why? Square rooting the results will give us two width and height to
            measure the triangle that we will be using as our ruler to measure the distance which is
            shown below: (insert triangle diagram) </article>
        <h4>Manhattan Distance</h4>
        <article>    
            Manhattan Distance measures the distance as the sum of the absolute differences between
            the coordinates of the points. It is named after the grid-like layout of streets in Manhattan,
            where the distance between two points is the sum of the absolute differences in their x and
            y coordinates. (insert grid structures here)
            <math>Manhattan = |x2 − x1| + |y2 − y1| </math>
    </article>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <article><h4>Problem: How can we use this knowledge in order to solve real world problems?</h4>
    <ul>1. Solve for the Location of the Parks that are near to each other.</ul>
<ul>
    2. Solve for the location of the user which is using the parks as the landmark in asking a
    friend for directions.
</ul>
<ul> 3. Know where a friend is using the landmarks that he / she is currently seeing.</ul>
<code>
    4. Know the path to take when visiting all of the parks and representing the path that is
    efficient and effective for fares to save money
</code>
<ul>
    5. A much more endless possibilities for searching for a more applications especially in
    location searching.

</ul> <br>
    There are a lot of possible implementation in knowing the nearest neighbor or the KNN
Classification problems but the problem that we have focused in knowing is Knowing the
path to take when visiting all of the parks and representing the path that is
efficient and effective for fares to save money because we want to make most of our
time and money.
</article>
    <h2>Code Implementation</h2>
    <h4>Import the Packages to Represent the Data:</h4>
<ul>
    (a) <bold>Pandas</bold> <br>
    Used in order to read the data which is a .csv file(comma-seperated values) to the
    model
</ul>
<ul>
    (b) <bold>Networkx</bold> <br>
    Used to represent the relationship of the data points with the
</ul>
<ul>
    (c) <bold>Matplotlib</bold> <br>
    Used to show the representation made by the Networkx package
</ul>
<h4>Code Process</h4>
    <ul>
        1. First is to display the dataframe which is just a table of all the available data that shows everything we know about the data.
    </ul>
    <code>
        <img src="/img/code_resource/4knn_model/loading_dataset.png" alt="">
    </code>
    <code>Figure 2: Loading the dataset to the model</code> 
<ul>
    2. Ask the user for his/her location to be used for calculating the Manhattan distance which
    is explained how far we are from the park.
</ul>
<ul>
    3. Grab the data from the table that we have loaded earlier and use the LATITUDE AND
    LONGITUDE to calculate the Manhattan Distance to be passed to our function to process
    and do it’s thing.
</ul>
<ul>
    4. Use the BUBBLE Sort algorithm in order to sort out the algorithm from nearest to the
    farthest away from the current location specified by the user.
</ul> 
    <code><img src="/img/code_resource/4knn_model/bubble_sort.gif" alt=""></code> <code>Figure 3: A simple bubble sort animation behind the scenes;
    <br>Source: Aphinya Dechalert</code>
    <article>
    You might be wondering why
    Bubble Sort? Simply, because it is simple to understand and implement. Bubble Sort works
    by comparing the values in an set of values and change their position if the other is more
    than the other in order to sort them out. This algorithm is still considered to be O(N 2)
    which means that the time needed in order to sort through the distances increases linearly
    as the data increases which is not as efficient as it is but for a smaller dataset like we have,
    it’s all good.
</article>
<ul>
    5. Next is we will present the result of our analytics to show the nearest park from our
    coordinates using a Ranking System that our sorting algorithm provided for us.
</ul>
    <code><img src="/img/code_resource/4knn_model/printing_result.png" alt=""></code>
    <code>Figure 4: Printing the top 3 parks nearest to our location</code>
<ul>
    6. Lastly, a graph or rather the map will be created as our guide in travelling through
    the parks to reach the all of the parks while saving money on transportation with the use
    Manhattan Distance and the Ranking System that we have created.
